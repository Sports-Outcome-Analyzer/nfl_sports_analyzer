This project was developed by me and Tashi.
The problem we are trying to solve is inaccurate predictions from all media outlets regarding a given weeks NFL games. Many people use these analyst predictions to place bets,
make fantasy football decisions, etc. If we are able to create a predective model that can use up to date statistics to predict a winner of a particular game, it could impact a fans 
decision regarding the game. If you are putting money on a team, you want to know you have made the right decision. Sports betting is a $150 billion dollar industry, you 
don't want to be the one losing.
Our project is a web-based application that allows users to log on and see the given weeks slate of NFL games with its corresponding predection. It will also show past 
weeks/seasons predictions and actual outcomes. This will allow the user to look back at past matchups to see if we got the prediction right.
Our project will give users another source of information/predictions to base their personal final prediction off of. There's never enough data available when making picks
in sports.
